### What changed?

### For developers:

**New development workflow:**

# Clone the monorepo
git clone https://github.com/florencito/florenapps-hub.git
cd florenapps-hub

# Find this app in:
# apps/[app-name]/

# Build all apps:
npm run build

# Build just this app:
npm run build:[app-name]

# Development server:
npm run dev:[app-name]
```
